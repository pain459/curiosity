Canary scripts are lightweight, automated scripts used to test the health and functionality of an environment (such as a system, application, or infrastructure) before deploying changes to production. They act as an early warning system to detect potential issues. The term "canary" is inspired by the historical practice of using canaries in coal mines to detect toxic gases. Similarly, canary scripts help identify problems in a controlled and safe manner.

### Features of Canary Scripts
1. **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on the environment, focusing on key checks.
2. **Automated**: Run without manual intervention, often as part of CI/CD pipelines.
3. **Specific**: Targeted tests for critical system components or functionalities.
4. **Safe**: Do not cause harm or disrupt the environment during execution.
5. **Quick to Execute**: Designed to run in seconds or minutes.

### Typical Use Cases
1. **Pre-deployment Testing**:
   - Verify that a staging or production environment is stable and operational.
   - Check configurations, dependencies, and connectivity.

2. **Post-deployment Verification**:
   - Ensure that newly deployed changes (e.g., updates, patches) do not break existing functionality.
   - Validate system responses and critical workflows.

3. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Run periodically to ensure the environment remains stable over time.

4. **Environment Validation**:
   - Verify that infrastructure (e.g., servers, databases, APIs) meets prerequisites for deployments.

### Examples of Canary Tests
1. **API Health Checks**:
   - Verify that APIs respond with the expected status codes and response times.
   - Validate schema and critical endpoints.

2. **Database Connectivity**:
   - Test whether the application can connect to databases and retrieve expected data.

3. **Dependency Verification**:
   - Ensure that external services (e.g., third-party APIs) are reachable and functioning.

4. **Basic Application Workflows**:
   - Simulate user actions like logging in, adding items to a cart, or submitting a form.

5. **Infrastructure Tests**:
   - Confirm that servers, load balancers, and storage systems are online and accessible.

6. **Configuration Checks**:
   - Validate environment variables, file permissions, or service configurations.

### Best Practices for Writing Canary Scripts
1. **Keep It Simple**:
   - Focus on key metrics or components critical to the system's functionality.
2. **Use Mock Data**:
   - Avoid using real production data to prevent unintended consequences.
3. **Fail Fast**:
   - Design scripts to quickly detect failures and terminate.
4. **Log Results**:
   - Provide clear and actionable logs or reports for troubleshooting.
5. **Integrate with CI/CD**:
   - Automate execution during deployment pipelines or as part of monitoring workflows.
6. **Isolate Tests**:
   - Ensure scripts do not impact the production environment or leave residual effects.

### Tools for Canary Testing
1. **Custom Scripts**:
   - Languages like Python, Bash, or JavaScript can be used to build bespoke scripts.
2. **Testing Frameworks**:
   - Tools like Selenium, Postman, or PyTest can automate environment checks.
3. **CI/CD Integrations**:
   - Leverage Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions to automate and schedule canary tests.
4. **Monitoring Tools**:
   - Use tools like Prometheus or New Relic for continuous monitoring and canary checks.

### Example: Basic Canary Script in Python
```python
import requests

def test_api_health():
    url = "https://example.com/health"
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("API is healthy.")
    else:
        print(f"API health check failed with status code {response.status_code}.")

def test_database_connection():
    # Example using a database library
    import psycopg2
    try:
        conn = psycopg2.connect(
            dbname="example_db",
            user="user",
            password="password",
            host="db.example.com",
            port="5432"
        )
        print("Database connection successful.")
        conn.close()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Database connection failed: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_api_health()
    test_database_connection()
```

This script runs basic checks to ensure the API and database are functioning as expected.
